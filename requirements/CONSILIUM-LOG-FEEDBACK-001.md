# log_feedback

> Atomically appends (or upgrades) a FEEDBACK.html row from a deliberation report.

## Description

Every line in this section is binding.

- `log_feedback.py` atomically appends a feedback entry to FEEDBACK.html from a deliberation report JSON, removing the manual friction of Step 6 outcome logging.
- `log_feedback.py` derives `date` (today), `context` (first 60 chars of `success_criterion`), `chosen` (from `chosen_approach`), an auto-generated `note` (candidate count, veto count, confidence, mode), and records the caller-supplied `outcome`.
- Before appending, it checks for duplicates using a 16-character SHA-256 fingerprint keyed on `date|chosen|context|run_id`.
- If the existing row has the same `run_path` but a different outcome (e.g., PEND->OK), the row is upgraded in place rather than duplicated.
- The sidecar `.run_path_map.json` is updated on every real write so `efficiency.py` and `audit_feedback.py` can later join outcomes to telemetry by run path.
- The `--outcome OK` path enforces a 0.70 confidence threshold gate, requiring `--force-override` to bypass.
- stdout is a `date | context | chosen | outcome | note` summary line (or `skipped (duplicate): ...` on exit 3).
- `.consilium/FEEDBACK.html` is updated atomically with the new or upgraded row; `.consilium/runs/.run_path_map.json` is updated with the new fingerprint->run_path entry.
- Exit code is 0 on success, 1 on validation error or confidence gate rejection, 2 on malformed JSON or missing required args, 3 on duplicate entry skipped.
- When `run_id` is absent, the fingerprint falls back to a microsecond-precision timestamp (`datetime.now().strftime("%f")`) as the 4th field, not a 3-field key. This prevents same-day collisions but makes the fingerprint non-deterministic.
- Two recomputed fingerprints for the same legacy row differ, so old no-run_id rows can never be matched by fingerprint lookup — they fall back to `run_path=None`.
- The confidence gate reads `report.get("confidence")` — the top-level key only. When a report carries both a top-level `confidence` and a nested `confidence.confidence` dict, the top-level value is used and the nested form is silently ignored.
- The row-upgrade path (PEND -> OK) uses a read-modify-write cycle protected only by `atomic_write_text` (rename-swap); there is no file lock or compare-and-swap.
- Two concurrent callers each read the same PEND state, and the last writer wins.
- Concurrent upgrades are not prevented; they are tolerated as an acceptable race, since `log_feedback.py` is not designed for concurrent use.

## Verify intent

- None - all questions resolved.

## Cases

- **CASE-1** — Given a report with a valid `success_criterion` and `chosen_approach`, when `log_feedback.py` runs, then it produces a new `<tr>` row in FEEDBACK.html with the correct date, truncated context, and derived note.
- **CASE-2** — Given the same report is appended twice with the same `--run-path` and the same `--outcome`, when the second call runs, then it exits 3 and does not add a duplicate row.
- **CASE-3** — Given the same report is appended twice with the same `--run-path` but a different outcome (e.g. PEND then OK), when the second call runs, then it upgrades the existing row in place and exits 0.
- **CASE-4** — Given `--outcome OK` with a report whose `confidence` is below 0.70, when the script runs without `--force-override`, then it exits 1 with an error message.
- **CASE-5** — Given `--outcome OVR` without `--override-target`, when the script runs, then it exits 2 with an error message to stderr.

## Context (non-binding)

**Notes** — Input: deliberation report JSON via stdin (required); `.consilium/FEEDBACK.html` (created if absent, overridable via `--feedback`); `.consilium/runs/.run_path_map.json` read and updated; CLI flags `--outcome OK|BAD|OVR|PEND|PEND_HEADLESS`, `--override-target`, `--user-note`, `--run-path`, `--dry-run`, `--force-override`. Contract addenda derive from a code audit dated 2026-06-04.

**Current implementation** — `scripts/log_feedback.py`.
