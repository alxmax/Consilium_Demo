# log_feedback

> Atomically appends (or upgrades) a FEEDBACK.html row from a deliberation report.

## Input
- Deliberation report JSON via stdin (required)
- `.consilium/FEEDBACK.html`: existing journal, created if absent (overridable via `--feedback`)
- `.consilium/runs/.run_path_map.json`: fingerprint-to-run-path sidecar (read and updated)
- CLI flags: `--outcome OK|BAD|OVR|PEND|PEND_HEADLESS`, `--override-target`, `--user-note`, `--run-path`, `--dry-run`, `--force-override`

## Description
Atomically appends a feedback entry to FEEDBACK.html from a deliberation report JSON, removing the manual friction of Step 6 outcome logging. It derives `date` (today), `context` (first 60 chars of `success_criterion`), `chosen` (from `chosen_approach`), an auto-generated `note` (candidate count, veto count, confidence, mode), and records the caller-supplied `outcome`. Before appending it checks for duplicates using a 16-character SHA-256 fingerprint keyed on `date|chosen|context|run_id`; if the existing row has the same `run_path` but a different outcome (e.g., PEND->OK), the row is upgraded in place rather than duplicated. The sidecar `.run_path_map.json` is updated on every real write so `efficiency.py` and `audit_feedback.py` can later join outcomes to telemetry by run path. The `--outcome OK` path enforces a 0.70 confidence threshold gate, requiring `--force-override` to bypass.

## Output
- stdout: `date | context | chosen | outcome | note` summary line (or `skipped (duplicate): ...` on exit 3)
- `.consilium/FEEDBACK.html`: updated atomically with the new or upgraded row
- `.consilium/runs/.run_path_map.json`: updated with the new fingerprint->run_path entry
- exit code 0 on success, 1 on validation error or confidence gate rejection, 2 on malformed JSON or missing required args, 3 on duplicate entry skipped

## Acceptance (= tests)
- A report with a valid `success_criterion` and `chosen_approach` produces a new `<tr>` row in FEEDBACK.html with the correct date, truncated context, and derived note.
- Appending the same report twice with the same `--run-path` and same `--outcome` exits 3 and does not add a duplicate row.
- Appending the same report twice with the same `--run-path` but a different outcome (e.g., PEND then OK) upgrades the existing row in place and exits 0.
- `--outcome OK` with a report whose `confidence` is below 0.70 exits 1 with an error message, unless `--force-override` is passed.
- `--outcome OVR` without `--override-target` exits 2 with an error message to stderr.
