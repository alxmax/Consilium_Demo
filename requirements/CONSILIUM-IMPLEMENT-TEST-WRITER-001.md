# implement-test-writer

> WHY: Separates test authorship from implementation to enable parallel execution and to enforce the Red→Green gate independently. The Test Writer owns test_* files exclusively; implementation files are never touched by this role.

## WHAT — Contract (normative)
- The Test Writer voice shall write `test_*` files only (disjoint-path rule); it shall never write or edit implementation files.
- Every test emitted shall satisfy the Red→Green gate: `fails_on_empty_impl` shall be true for each test — meaning the test must fail against a `raise NotImplementedError` stub and pass against the real implementation. A test that passes against the stub is not pinning behavior and is rejected.
- Test Writer output shall be strict JSON containing `test_files_written[]` (each entry has `path` and `covers`), `tests[]` (each entry has `name`, `targets_symbol`, `behavior_pinned`, `fails_on_empty_impl`, `why`), and `uncoverable[]`.
- Malformed or non-JSON output is a hard failure; the implement-subagent retries once, then aborts.

## WHAT — Verify intent
- None — all questions resolved.

## HOW — Acceptance (= tests)
AC-1
  Given a well-formed success_criterion and files_written from the Coder
  When  the Test Writer completes
  Then  output parses as JSON, test_files_written is non-empty (every path starts with test_), and every test in tests[] has fails_on_empty_impl = true

AC-2
  Given a test emitted by the Test Writer
  When  the implement-subagent runs the Red→Green gate
  Then  the test is RED against a stub implementation and GREEN against the real one; any test that is green under the stub appears in gate_rejected

AC-3
  Given a behavior that cannot be covered by automated tests
  When  the Test Writer identifies it
  Then  it appears in uncoverable[] with a reason and no test is emitted for it
