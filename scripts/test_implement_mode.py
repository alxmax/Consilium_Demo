"""Smoke test for recommend_implement_mode (Step 7 routing gate).

Run: python scripts/test_implement_mode.py   (exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure)

Gate contract: pipeline iff the change warrants a `review` step (regression-prone
quadrants); single_shot otherwise. Keyed on reversibility/magnitude, NOT size.
