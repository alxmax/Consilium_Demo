"""Validate a Skeptic voice output against the prompts/voices/skeptic.md gate.

Reads a Skeptic verdict (JSON) from stdin. Exits 0 iff the verdict is well-formed
per the validation gate documented in prompts/voices/skeptic.md; exits 1 (problems
on stderr) if invalid — the orchestrator then ships the original chosen
unchallenged, per modes/skeptic_on_chosen.md Step 3; exits 2 on malformed JSON.

WHY THIS EXISTS: skeptic.md describes a validation gate ("the skeptic output is
discarded ...") but until now NO code ran it — the gate was prose only, so a
malformed/under-evidenced objection could pass unchecked (audit 2026-06-14,
skeptic-adversarial-rigor -> adversarial_enforce_gate_in_code).

ENFORCED (structural, self-contained) rules:
- can_object must be a bool.
- can_object=false -> objection must be null/absent (nothing to validate; ship original).
- can_object=true  -> objection is an object with:
    * concrete_concerns: list of strings; quoted_scenario: str|null
    * EVIDENCE (the core gate): >=2 non-empty concrete_concerns OR a non-empty
      quoted_scenario — anything weaker is "not enough evidence" and is rejected.
    * failure_mode in {correctness, goal_fit, verification_inadequate, meta_scope_mismatch}
    * addressable in {in_place, requires_redesign, unaddressable}
    * failure_mode=goal_fit -> at least one concrete_concern references
      "success_criterion" (skeptic.md mandates the phrasing "success_criterion says
      X but chosen does Y"); its absence is the fabrication signal the gate rejects.

NOT ENFORCED (need semantics + the success_criterion text, not just shape): whether
a concern is "vague", whether a cited constraint actually appears in
success_criterion, whether a verification_inadequate scenario is genuinely specific.
Those gate rules require judgment; this validator enforces the machine-checkable
subset that previously went entirely unchecked.
