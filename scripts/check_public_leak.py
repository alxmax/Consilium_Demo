"""Guard: the published repo must not point back to its private source.

Fails (exit 1) if any tracked file references the private development
repository (any `alxmax/[Cc]onsilium…` that is not `…_Demo`) or leaks a
local absolute dev path. This keeps the public release repo decoupled from
its private source across rebuilds and dev->demo migrations — a private-repo
reference becomes un-shippable rather than a silent leak (e.g. the explainer's
"View repository" link, which once pointed at the private repo).

    python scripts/check_public_leak.py        # exit 1 + offending file:line on any hit

Stdlib only. Wired into CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml). Patterns are written
with character classes so this guard file does not match its own source.
