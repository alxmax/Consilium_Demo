"""Regression tests for probe_change path decoding (the security-gate fix).

Run: python scripts/test_probe_change.py   (exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure)

Origin: 2026-05-31 audit Critical — git C-quotes paths with non-ASCII/space/
control bytes (e.g. ``"auth/fi\\305\\237ier.py"``). Left verbatim, the leading
double-quote defeats blocklist prefix/glob matching, silently downgrading a
critical change (auth/, migrations/, ...) to trivial. ``_unquote_git_path``
decodes the C-quoted form back to a plain UTF-8 path so the blocklist sees the
real prefix; ``parse_numstat`` applies it per line.

This guards the ACTUAL fixed code: it calls _unquote_git_path / parse_numstat
directly. A scope_gate --signals-stdin scenario would NOT — it injects
pre-parsed signals and bypasses the parser entirely (false coverage).
